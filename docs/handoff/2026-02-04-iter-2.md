# Handoff: 2026-02-04 (Iteration 2)

## Summary

Added maintainability/security guardrails and architectural docs for Codemm-IDE.

## What’s Done

- Added `AGENTS.md` defining:
  - incremental commits + pushes
  - mandatory handoff docs per iteration
  - Electron security defaults
  - definition of “bundled” target state
- Added security + architecture docs:
  - `docs/SECURITY.md`
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Next Steps (Proposed)

1. Make Codemm-IDE “self-contained” as a repo:
   - bring `Codemm-backend` + `Codemm-frontend` into this repo (monorepo) OR
   - add an explicit bootstrap step (submodules/subtrees) with clear docs.
2. Package as a real macOS app:
   - `electron-builder`
   - Next production build (prefer `output: "standalone"`)
   - rebuild native deps (`better-sqlite3`) for Electron
3. Harden Electron navigation:
   - block window.open / external navigation
   - allowlist only local URLs
