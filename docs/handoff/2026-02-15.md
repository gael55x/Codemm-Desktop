## Summary

- Improved app launch UX: the startup splash now includes deterministic progress bars and status text instead of a static “Launching…” screen.

## Iteration Log

### Iteration 1 (Startup Splash Progress)

- Added progress bars to the Electron startup splash and updated them across boot phases (deps, Docker judge, engine, UI) (`apps/ide/main.js`).

### Iteration 2 (Splash Simplification)

- Simplified the startup splash to a single progress bar with a changing status line (still stage-driven/deterministic) (`apps/ide/main.js`).

## How to Run

- Dev: `npm run dev`

## Known Issues / Next

- Progress is coarse stage-based (deterministic) rather than log-derived per-Docker-step progress.
