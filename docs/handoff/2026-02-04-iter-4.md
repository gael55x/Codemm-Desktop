# Handoff: 2026-02-04 (Iteration 4)

## Summary

Fixed Electron window lifecycle so the app window reliably appears on macOS.

## What’s Done

- Prevented the BrowserWindow from being garbage-collected by keeping a global reference:
  - `apps/ide/main.js`
- Added crash visibility:
  - `uncaughtException` + `unhandledRejection` show an error dialog and log to terminal.
- Added macOS activation behavior:
  - clicking the dock icon re-shows or re-creates the window.

## How To Run

From repo root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Notes

If the window still doesn't show, the terminal logs should now include `[ide] ...` and any fatal error dialog should surface the underlying exception.
